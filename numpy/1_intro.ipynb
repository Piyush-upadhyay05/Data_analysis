    "- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental Python library for performing scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- support large number of data in the form of multidiimensional array and matrix . \n",
    "\n",
    "- used for mathematic calculation like linear algebra , fourier transform and random number capabilities etc .\n",

    "#### why Numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- python list are flexible but they are slow for numeric operations . numpy offers :\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Faster computation (thanks to C-based implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Efficient memory usage\n",
